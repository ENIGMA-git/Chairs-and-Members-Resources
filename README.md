# Chairs and Members Resources

The ENIGMA Consortium is an international effort by leaders worldwide. The Consortium brings together researchers in imaging genomics, neurology and psychiatry, to understand brain structure and function, based on MRI, DTI, fMRI, genetic data and many patient populations.

The best return on our research investments will come from combining our data to achieve the large samples necessary to detect the modest gene effect sizes that we now know are the rule rather the exception for complex traits.

The ENIGMA Consortium has several goals:

to create a network of like-minded individuals, interested in pushing forward the field of imaging genetics
to ensure promising findings are replicated via member collaborations, in order to satisfy the mandates of most journals
to share ideas, algorithms, data, and information on promising findings or methods
to facilitate training, including workshops and conferences on key methods and emerging directions in imaging genetics.

There are 50 active ENIGMA working groups!! Full details of each ENIGMA group and how to join can be accessed [here](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/).
